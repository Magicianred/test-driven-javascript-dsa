Maybe writing all unit tests ahead of time to cover all possible edge cases for a specific function is quite impractical due to time always being against us; hopefully, the practice of test-driven development, with the time we can give it, can aid a mindset of considering the full breadth of scenarios for often open-ended problems and their potential solutions.

This is my own educational journey of understanding the how and why for JavaScript code written to solve common, and often ambiguous, problems. I hope you find my examples helpful as I start to add more.
