It's understandably easy to write code with only the happy path in mind. However, Murphy's law is inevitable, of course â€” especially as applications become increasingly dependent on any particular piece of code.
<br><br>
Maybe writing all unit tests ahead of time to cover all possible edge cases for a specific function is quite impractical due to time always being against us; however, hopefully, the practice of test-driven development with the time we can salvage, for business or non-business purposes, can aid a mindset of considering the full breadth of scenarios for often open-ended problems and their associated solutions.
<br><br>
This is my own educational journey of understanding the how and why for JavaScript code written to solve common, and often ambiguous, problems. I hope you find my examples helpful as I start to add more.
